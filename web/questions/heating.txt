Q1: What is the research article about? 
Q2: What changes occur in food when cooked? 
Q3: What aesthetic qualities are affected by cooking? 
Q4: How does cooking affect nutritional value?

1. What processes occur during cooking that affect the appearance, taste and smell of food?
2. What are some nutritional losses that can occur during cooking?
3. How are proteins affected by cooking?
4. How are vitamins affected by cooking?

1. Reasons for cooking food: enhance flavour, texture, appearance, increase nutritional value. 
2. Conduction: heat is transferred by direct contact of particles, e.g. metal pan on stovetop. 
3. Convection: warm liquid circulates around the food, e.g. boiling an egg. 
4. Types of radiation used: microwaves, infrared and ultraviolet. Microwaves heat food from inside out, infrared from outside in, ultraviolet sterilizes. 
5. Boiling: water is heated to boiling point, food cooked in boiling water. Foods suitable: vegetables, pasta, rice, etc. 
6. Boiling vs. Steaming: boiling uses hot water, steaming uses steam. Advantages of steaming: retains more nutrients, faster cooking time. 
7. Heat transfer in braising: conduction, convection and radiation. 
8. Suitable for grilling: meats, fish, vegetables. 
9. Methods producing most browning: frying, roasting, broiling. 
10. Safety risks of deep fat frying: fire hazard, burns, splattering oil.
